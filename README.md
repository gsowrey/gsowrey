ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Geoff (@gsowrey)!

I've been a programmer since teaching myself BASICA on PC-DOS 1.1 on an IBM 5150, somewhere back in the mid-80s. Over the last 30-ish years, I've done a lot of web development, ranging from the simplest HTML to full-stack implementations.

I work as [VP, Technology for one of Canada's largest independent marketing firms](https://linkedin.com/in/sowrey/), though I still find time to monkey about in some personal projects, when I'm not assisting my amazing team.
